## Confounding, Chance, and Bias

**Title**: Confounding, chance, and bias

**Presenter(s)**: Cochrane Austria, Department for Evidence-based Medicine and Evaluation, Danube University Krems

the goal of clinical studies is to investigate the efficacy and safety of treatments they leave room for three important sources of error that could lead to false study results confounding chance and bias confounders confuse us in interpreting study results and may lead us to infer incorrect conclusions about cause and effect relationships for example in one study we observed that those who drink a lot of coffee are at an increased risk for coronary heart disease is coffee dangerous for heart health or could another factor be responsible for this relationship in our example smoking is responsible for the observed relationship smoking is a risk factor for coronary heart disease people who smoke tend to be people who drink a lot of coffee so taking the confounders smoking not into account one would draw the wrong conclusion that drinking coffee is a risk factor for heart disease we are dealing with the confounder

*Properties of confounders (= confounding factors)*

if the following properties are present the confounder must be related to the outcome regardless of the exposure in our coffee example this means that smoking is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease regardless of whether someone drinks coffee or not the confounder must be related to the exposure in our example this means that people who smoke often often drink coffee the confounder should not be on the causal pathway between the exposure and outcome this condition would also be fulfilled in our example drinking coffee does not automatically lead to smoking how do you deal with confounders

*How do you deal with confounders?*

you can get a grip on confounders that you know in advance in the planning phase for example the inclusion criteria of a study are defined so narrowly that the influence of confounders is eliminated this procedure is called restriction one can also consider confounding in the analysis for example with stratification in our coffee study we would stratify all individuals into groups that is divide them into smokers and non-smokers and examine in both groups if there is a connection between coffee drinking and heart disease if only people who smoke are at an increased risk for heart disease then we would see that drinking coffee is not the cause of heart disease we are mostly dealing with several confounders here multivariate analyses can be calculated which adjusts for several confounders but what do you do with confounders that are unknown to us

*What do you do when a confounder is unknown?*

the only way to deal with unknown confounders is randomization the study participants are randomly divided into study arms the randomization leads to an equal distribution of known and unknown confounders in the study groups if one observes a difference between the groups after an intervention we can assume that this was caused by the intervention and not because influencing factors were already distributed differently between the groups at the beginning randomization is the only effective remedy against unknown confounders

*Chance*

another source of error in studies is chance also called random error the result of a study may coincidentally differ from the true effect in the population just by chance this random deviation has no definite direction if you were to do many of the same studies some would overestimate the effect others underestimate and others would appreciate it correctly one can minimize the influence of chance by large sample size imagine you have a bowl of 500 green and 500 red gummy bears you draw two samples one with ten gummy bears and one with a hundred in the small sample it can be easy for you to draw eight green and two red gummy bears with 100 gummy bears you are probably already much closer to the 50 50 distribution it's similar with studies in very small studies it may happen despite randomization that the study groups are not similar a non-evidence-based rule of thumb states that studies with fewer than 300 study participants are susceptible to random variability additionally a low event rate is prone to random error a large study size can minimize random errors

bias is another source of error in studies bias is a systematic deviation from the true effect that can be caused through the design conduction or analysis of a study in contrast to random error bias would always distort the results in the same direction if one would perform the study multiple times there is a variety of bias subcategories here are four types of bias that play an important role in interventional studies selection bias performance bias measurement bias and attrition bias

*Selection bias*

selection bias describes the problem that there are systematic differences in the allocation of study participants imagine a study examines the effects of a physical exercise program versus no intervention and study participants choose which group they go into it is very likely that more sports enthusiasts and health-conscious people opt for the sports group thus two groups would form that would not be comparable from the start in some aspects if at the end of the study it emerges that the sports group had better results this could not be automatically assigned to the intervention since the group already started with better starting conditions selection bias can be avoided by randomization and secrecy of the randomization sequence also called allocation concealment

*Performance bias*

performance bias occurs when apart from the intervention under investigation there are systematic differences in the treatment and care of patients for example the type of care and attention changes with the intravenous administration of a medication so if you compare two drugs that are administered differently it remains unclear whether a different effect is due only to the drug or to the other care and attention given in order to prevent performance bias it helps to have a standardized treatment concept for all study groups and to blind all people involved in a study blinding means that the participants in a study are not aware of which people receive which treatment

*Measurement bias*

measurement bias exists when there are systematic differences in measuring outcomes for example if a person evaluates their knee pain knowing if they were in the intervention or comparison group can influence the perception of the pain to prevent measurement bias those who measure the outcomes should not know which individuals receive the intervention and which the control intervention this allows them to assess the outcomes unaffected and objectively with attrition bias

*Attrition bias*

premature exit from the study results in systematic differences between study groups in general it is normal for some people to leave studies early however it becomes problematic if this happens systematically and not accidentally suppose those who feel particularly unpleasant or have many side effects leave the study if at the end of the study we only look at those in the analysis that remained in the study until the very end we would ironically believe that there were very few side effects one can minimize the influence of attrition bias in the data evaluation by providing an attention to treat analysis that includes all individuals originally randomized to a study

*Risk of bias*

when we critically evaluate studies we try to estimate the risk of bias bias cannot be measured directly the risk of bias can only be assessed indirectly through evaluation of the study design and the execution of studies in addition the risk of bias between outcomes may vary for example while subjective outcomes such as pain can be strongly influenced by lack of blinding this has no effect on hard outcomes such as mortality

*Components of a study result*

the aim of studies is to map the true effect of an intervention as well as possible that is the distorting influence of confounding chance and bias should be contained as much as possible a large sample can minimize the influence of random air the study design the good execution of the study and the analysis can minimize the influence of confounding and bias

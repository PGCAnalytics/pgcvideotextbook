# 8.1 SNP Heritability {#sec-section1}

> In this video by Dr. Price, we get a comprehensive overview of heritability, as defined through twin studies and SNP heritability as defined with genetic analyses. The video touches on the idea of "missing" heritability, with a comprehensive delve into possible explanations for missing heritability, and how to measure heritability through different methods.

# 8.6 Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) {#sec-section6}

> *Goals of this section:*
>
> 1.  *Be able to define GWAS and understand the general genetic architecture of common risk variants*
>
> 2.  *Be able to define an eQTL (Expression Quantitative Trait Loci) and how they may be useful to interpreting GWAS results*
>
> 3.  *Obtain a solid understanding of eQTLs and related analytical approaches.*
>
> 4.  *Examine the role of eQTLs in the relationship of genes and molecular networks with phenotypic QTLs (pQTLs).*
>
> 5.  *Understand eQTLs for co-expression networks.*
>
> This first short video by Dr. Liu briefly reviews GWAS studies and the GWAS catalog resource in order to discuss a main caveat of GWAS - that most significant trait associated variants lay in non-coding regions of the genome with putative regulatory function. The video then presents expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) as a method to connect SNPs to gene regulatory effects in a tissue-specific manner.

> The second video by Dr. Auget introduces expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis, discusses how to address batch effects and covariate correction, and control for false discovery rate.
>
> The third video by Dr. Saba explains the concepts of transcriptome-wide association studies, gene expression prediction related to phenotypes of interest, and accompanying statistical tests.
>
> In the fourth video, Drs. O'Connor and Weiner discuss the relevance of gene regulation in GWAS, explains transcriptome-wide association studies and co-localization of GWAS with eQTLs as methods to link SNPs to gene expression and trait associations, discusses proximity and the abstract mediation model, and covered combining multiple SNP-to-gene strategies based on the Nature Genetics Publication: "Combining SNP-to-gene linking strategies to identify disease genes and assess disease omnigenicity".

> In the following videos, we will explore Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies, or TWAS, including various TWAS methods. In the first video, Dr. Gusev explains the concepts of transcriptome-wide association studies, gene expression prediction related to phenotypes of interest, and accompanying statistical tests.

# 8.8 PheWAS {#sec-section8}

> The following videos provide an overview of the Phenone-Wide Association Study (PheWAS). The first video by Dr. Denny talks about how PheWAS and GWAS could work in concert with each other and what data are used for the phenome. After 9:45, Dr. Josh Denny pivots the focus from PheWAS to phenotypic risk score (PheRS). In the second video, Dr. Davis gives an example of PheWAS and how to interpret the PheWAS results (starting 28:15). **Note**: There is no current video on Laboratory-Wide Association Studies (*LabWAS*) yet, but the concept is similar to PheWAS and in this Youtube video, Dr. Lea Davis talked briefly on the QC of the lab results in the BioVU Biobank (starting 39:00).

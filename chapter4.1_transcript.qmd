hello and welcome to this video on epidemiological studies we're going to have a quick look at epidemiological studies what they are a few different types of studies their advantages and disadvantages

*What is a study?*

first of all what is a study well simply put a study is a scientific process of answering a question using data from a population it can be any question for example does smoking caused cancer is there more disease in an area compared to another or what food is responsible for causing an outbreak so the first thing to do in any study is to have a study question what are we trying to find out then we need to figure out what the best type of study is that would help us answer the question once we've decided on a study type we need to do the study collect and analyze the data using a suitable statistical method then we need to interpret the results to make sense of it all and finally we need to report the results of our study importantly all studies need to be done in an ethical way now let's have a look at a few different study types

ECOLOGICAL STUDY

an ecological study is the type of study where measurements like disease rates and information about exposures are made on a group of people the groups can be as small as people in a house or as large as people in an entire country it's important to remember that results and conclusions from ecological studies apply to a group and not to individuals ecological studies are useful for comparing the health of populations in different places such as measles rates in Australia and New Zealand or at different times they're also useful for generating questions and highlighting issues that can lend themselves to future investigations or studies

CASE SERIES

a case series describes the characteristics of a group of people who have the same disease or the same exposure the aim of this is to understand the demographics clinical presentation prognosis or other characteristics of people who have a particular disease or describe something on you for example in the early 1980s the occurrence of an unusual pneumonia in men led to the recognition and identification of HIV a cross-sectional study takes a selected population and measures health information at a given point in time giving a snapshot of their health it usually involved asking participants a series of questions using a questionnaire health surveys that collect health information about people in a population is an example of a cross-sectional study because these studies commonly measure how many people have a disease at a particular point of time they're also called prevalence studies it's important to make sure that the selected population is representative of the total population

CROSS SECTIONAL STUDY- prevalence studies

cross-sectional studies are relatively inexpensive and easy to conduct compared to other studies they can provide information on multiple exposures and outcomes and are a good way of assessing the health needs of a population however because the information is collected at a single point in time it cannot be used to determine whether a particular exposure caused the disease or not

CASE CONTROL STUDY

a case control study starts off with cases these are people with a disease it uses a comparison group called controls who are similar to cases but do not have the disease then both groups are asked about their previous exposures to different risk factors now for each of the risk factors the odds of being exposed if they were a case is compared to the odds of being exposed if they were a control this is called an odds ratio an odds ratio of more than one means that people with the disease are more likely to have been exposed to that risk factor than people without the disease this suggests that it could be a possible cause of the disease an odds ratio of less than one suggests that it's a protective factor and one suggests no association case control studies are commonly used in foodborne outbreak investigations for example we can compare the odds of eating different kinds of food between people who fell ill after consuming a meal and those who didn't if the odds ratio is greater than 1 for a particular type of food then it's possibly the cause of the illness a major advantage of a case control study is that they're often quick and cheap to do also because they start off with cases it can be used to study uncommon diseases however because these studies involve small numbers they're not good to study rare exposures one of the challenges in a case control study is to find suitably matched controls also because studies ask about exposures in the past and people might not be able to recall their exposures accurately

COHORT STUDY

let's have a look at cohort studies now in a cohort study a group of people has followed over a period of time to see what happens to them and information about risk factors is collected we can then compare the risk factors occurrence of an outcome like disease in those who are exposed to a particular risk factor to those who are not exposed to that risk factor the main measurement used in cohort studies is called the relative risk a relative risk is the ratio between the risk of disease in the exposed group compared to the risk of disease in the unexposed group a relative risk of greater than 1 means that the exposure is associated with an increased risk of the disease if it is 1 it indicates that the risk is the same and if it's less than 1 it indicates that the risk is lower a well-known cohort study is the British doctor study done in the 1950s where a group of doctors were followed up for many years this study provided valuable scientific evidence of the harmful effects of smoking especially the link between smoking and lung cancer one of the main advantages of cohort studies is advantages that the time sequence of events can be determined this is useful when trying to determine what caused a disease another advantage is that information about several different outcomes and risk factors can be collected at the same time this allows for some analysis to be conducted on the data a disadvantage of cohort studies is the high cost and they can involve a large number of people being followed over a long period of time they're generally not suitable to study rare diseases a challenge in cohort studies especially ones that are conducted over a long period of time is ensuring that people who started the study stay until the end of the study if many people drop out it will affect the results of the study

INTERVENTIONAL STUDY

now let's look at another type of study an interventional study in an interventional study an intervention is done on a group of people and the outcome studied examples of interventions can be giving a medicine a vaccine or health advice the outcome can be things like a change in disease status or change in behavior a randomized controlled study is the best study design for an interventional study say we want to study the effects of a new drug we start off with a study population people are then randomly allocated to be in the intervention group where they receive the drug or in the control group where they don't receive the drug then after a suitable time period the outcomes in the two groups are assessed and compared to see what effect the drug had outcomes can be things like a change in disease symptoms or death rates ideally neither the participants nor the investigators should know which group received the intervention this is called double blinding and ensures that neither of them can influence the outcome of the study the main advantage of a randomized control study is that it can provide good evidence that the intervention led to an outcome randomization ensures that both groups have an equal chance of receiving the intervention and that they have similar characteristics this way the effect of the intervention can be determined without other factors influencing the outcome the disadvantages are that these studies are generally quite expensive to do it may also require a large number of participants it may not be suitable in some situations we're not giving an intervention may be inappropriate or unethical

SUMMARIES

finally sometimes it's hard to keep up with all the studies that have been done on a particular topic but thankfully there are studies that summarize other studies there are two main ways that this is done a systematic review systematically identifies all the relevant studies on a particular topic assesses the quality of each study synthesizes and interprets the findings and presents an impartial unbiased and balanced summary of the evidence a meta-analysis uses data from all the studies that have addressed the same question and have a similar study design it then uses the data from these studies to do a combined statistical analysis and produces a single summary result and that's an overview of some of the commonly used epidemiological study types we've had a look at what a study is different study types their advantages and disadvantages

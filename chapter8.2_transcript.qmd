**Title**: Genetic Correlation and Partitioning

**Presenter(s)**: Patrick Turley, ATGU, Massachusetts General Hospital

so now we're going to talk about genetic correlation and and partitioning so we're gonna we're going to start with genetic relation I'm gonna talk more broadly about a term that that that we call just genetic overlap and so so a lot of traits have have really similar genetic architecture that is if we find a snip that is causal for some trait like educational attainment it's it's more likely once we found it for education attainment we might think that it's more likely to also be associated with things like cognitive performance or a bunch of other traits you know that schizophrenia and so so we maybe want to get an estimate of how how strong that relationship is you know what if we do find a snip for one trait how likely is it that it's going to also be causal for the other just as just as a vocab that I don't think has has come up we haven't defined specifically so there's the the state where one snip is associated with a variety of phenotypes that's called pleiotropy so some says oh there's pleiotropic it means that that genes do more than one thing and and so because there's pleiotropy that's why there's going to be genetic overlap and so why why might we care about overlap well you know it might help us untangle complicated causal relationships so if we see that all of

the snips that are important for

education are also important for for schizophrenia then you know might say oh so those those two things have have a genetic a genetic relationship you know if we see that depression is is highly genetically correlated with neuroticism I mean like okay yeah the the genetic you know additive contribution to those two traits is is similar and so that can help us as we're thinking about what might be causing both of them it also can help us prioritize causal pathways and so so like let's this this is sort of related to maybe the proxy phenotype method and so let's say that we know that that education and cognitive performance are highly genetically correlated we don't have very large samples for cognitive performance well if we know that they're highly related then we could you know limit the space over which we're looking at the genome by just taking you know snips that are associated with educational attainment above a certain level and look for the association with cognitive performance there and as a result we don't have to do as large a multiple testing correction because we're doing fewer tests you know also if we know that things are related and we're trying to like figure out how you know it'll just point us in the right direction sorry so I think that when at least historically when people have said candidate gene it was based on sort of a theoretical biological relationship and so he said oh yeah this is this gene we think it has to do with this and so we're going to we're going you know we're gonna test the test for that whereas when I say proxy phenotype it's it's less of a theoretical relationship that we're using to select about an empirical one yeah great and so there's kind of two so when we say overlap there's sort of two ways to think about it so ones enrichment and ones genetic correlation and so so enrichment is is this idea of kind of a proxy phenotype method you know our snips that are important for for a phenotype a also important for a phenotype B and so we could do this test we're just gonna take the snips with a p-value of less than P naught and we're gonna test them in an aji was\--for phenotype B and so that that could be pretty successful in seeing like if you know do the snips and phenotype B in that subset are they you know more likely to be more significant that's sort of the the very high view question but there's a few technical

questions first off how would you pick

the threshold are we just going to look

at snips that are genome-wide

significant or should we look maybe

lower in the distribution how do you deal with LD so let's say you have two snips and they're highly correlated with each other but this snip is really important for phenotype eh but not at all important for phenotype B and this snip is really important for phenotype B but not for phenotype a if we just compared Gy summary statistic we would say oh yeah these are both important and so these traits might be related but when it comes down to the actual you know the actual effect of those particular snips they're they're not related at all and so we should keep keep in mind that you know we're you know we have this sense when we have gos summary statistics you shouldn't think snip you should think sort of like region around the snip there's another question oh yeah that's a that's a question I don't know the answer to actually does anyone is there anyone with a bio background who knows this I was wondering this just the other day so the question is if if you have a gene that you know is important for some phenotype are other genes that are going to be important that phenotype may be going to be nearby like on the same chromosome or nearby yeah either close to each other on the chromosome were just on the chromosome yeah yeah so I guess for expression we know that there's some local localness but had gee I wish I was that again that are far away then so those are ones that are associated with smoking behaviors I mean if it's highly polygenic mm-hmm yeah yeah so III I wish I knew the answer as well and someone maybe does but I don't know and

it's relevant for a lot of the lot of the things that we do like remember how I told you one of the assumptions in LC LD score regression is that these betas are independent and if genes that are important for specific things tend to be close to each other that also means that they're in high OD with each other and so it might it might break you know might violate the assumptions about these score regressions so I so I don't know the answer but I wish I did so here's another question so like let's let's say we did was was that a question was out of stretching okay and so let's let's say that we you know we have our education our 74 education associated snips and then we looked them up in a height G wasps and we find that all of them are associated with height you know do we think that that is a signal that the two traits are strongly related I'm gonna say no who can give me a reason why we might not expect that you yet so so you would you wouldn't want to interpret the fact that every single education snip is is is associated with height as well yes I guess the direction could be one thing what what else might we think about because the direction if it's associated could go and okay yeah yeah but we're just looking for general enrichment we don't we're nothing about direction mm-hmm yeah I mean if that's the case then we actually do think they related I guess so so yes I guess maybe I should have picked something that are unrelated let's say there's traits that aren't I mean I guess I guess maybe I shouldn't make you keep guessing but maybe it's good that you were thinking but Heights really polygenic right so why is that relevant yeah he is really probably jinuk but but specifically hyping you know if we had a trade that wasn't polygenic let's say there was only one gene and and it was the only gene and we find that that gene also is important for height yeah because of random snip drawn from the genome is likely to be associated with height all right and so we should keep that in mind also when we're doing these tests so we've got to think what's what's what's the you know what is our expected significance and and so cuz we're talking about you know are things more significant than we expect you have to ask the questions what do we expect and saying that we expect know you know that between knows maybe not right there's also a question of one side or two-sided test which gets to this idea you know is do we want to think about the sign or not if we see a positive effect in education if we just want to see if that leads to positive effects in height then that that's a one-sided test but if we just want to say do we expect a large effect in height we don't care if it's negative or positive then that would be a two-sided test and so that's that's just a decision that we need to make and so here here are some some examples of kind of the thing I told you so we take the 74 education snips we're about at a time but I will stop at the end of the overlap stuff and then I want to see if it is associated with the G wasps on the size of your of your thalamus in your brain and so the 45-degree line is what we would expect to see if if they were all no and so we see that you know it does sort of peel

away from from no so so there are more you know it doesn't that there might be a little bit of extra signal relative to the null but we can test the how much there's enrichment there is based on how polygenic we think the trade is and and we you know we have a p-value of 0.02 inflation that we're seeing is just due to chance however if we look at the education snips and a G loss of cognitive performance you know we start seeing it peel away like pretty quickly and our p-value there is is point zero to just based on you know how significant are these relative to what we'd expect if you look at schizophrenia it peels away even more schizophrenia I think's a funny case so if we look at at cognitive performance the sign concordance is ninety percent so that means a snip that increases education you know ninety percent of the time we'll also estimate it to increase cognitive performance and so you know is highly enriched schizophrenia we see you know it's it's highly highly enriched we can see just by looking at these points that there's a lot of enrichment however the sign concordance is 51 percent which means that a snip that's associated with education it's likely to be important for schizophrenia but we can't really guess if it's gonna be protective of schizophrenia or or what's the opposite it's more more causal it's gonna be more likely to lead to schizophrenia and so that's kind of a funny case so I think that we should break for lunch and we can talk about genetic correlation briefly after lunch
